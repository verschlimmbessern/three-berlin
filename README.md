This wiki contains useful information for residents of Three Berlin at Hartriegelstraße and Moosstraße which is managed by the [Hamburg Team](/contacts/hamburg-team.md).

## Heating

Heating is part of your rent and depends on the size of your apartment.

### Setting Room Temperature

When the thermostat is set to the middle point, it will try to maintain the room temperature at a certain value (e.g. 18 °C). Setting it to max i.e. level 6 and it will try to maintain the room temperature at the maximum value (e.g. 21 °C). This value is determined by the landlord. You should hear a slight "click" when moving the thermostat above the middle point.

### Too Cold?

Set all thermostats in your apartment to the maximum value and wait for 2-3 hours. If the temperature does not increase, please contact the Housmeister, there might be an issue with the heating in your apartment.

## Electricity

In Germany, all homes have electricity provided by the default provider i.e. Grundversorgung. In Berlin, this is Vattenfall. See:

> <https://www.vattenfall.de/geschaeftskunden-electricity-supply-germany>

If you do not sign up a contract with any electricity provider (i.e. individual contract, `Ersatzversorgung`), Vattenfall will sign you up with their basic tariff. Basic tariff price (Ct./kWh) is not fixed and depends on the market. Individual contract on the other hand, usually offers fixed price for 12-24 months period. You have to decide which one you think will be cheaper on the long term.

In general, you will be charged a fixed amount each month, depending on the number of households. For example, a single and two households are estimated to use 1500 kWh and 2500 kWh respectively. At the end of the year, a meter reading will be taken if your usage was higher than the estimate, you have to pay the difference. If it was lower, you will be refunded.

### Providers
